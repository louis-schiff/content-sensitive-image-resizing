Content-Sensitive-Image-Resizing
================================

Content-sensitive image resizing using seam-carving, based on Avidan, Shamir 2007

The idea is to figure out what's important in an image, and then reduce the image without distorting the important parts.

To automatically identify "interesting" parts of a image, I used gradient magnitude as an energy function. Then removed an 8-connected one-pixel-wide seam, one at a time, based on minimizing the cumulative-sum of energy values along a seam using dynamic programming. For this energy function, the seam choice by the algorithm is provablly optimal.

These last three show the results generated by the matlab script. They are compressed significanly but even without preserving aspect ratio, there is no distortion of important parts. 

The interesting bits are the same, but the distance between them has changed.

In this last one, the image is reduced in pixels by 75%, but all the baloons are still there and they are all the same size, which is highly-awesome.
